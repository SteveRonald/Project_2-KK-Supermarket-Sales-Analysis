## About the Project
This project analyzes sales data from KK Supermarket to determine whether the business made a profit or not and to identify the key factors that contributed to its performance. The dataset includes transactional details such as date, product, quantity sold, unit price, store location, cashier, total price, and original price.

### Business Questions Addressed:
- What is the total sales revenue?
- Which products, cashiers, and store locations performed the best?
- Are there seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
- Which products are consistently high-sellers across different locations?
- What are the peak sales days and times?

The analysis goes beyond descriptive analysis to include trend identification, advanced visualizations (dashboards and heatmaps), and forecasting next month's sales using statistical methods. The ultimate goal is to uncover actionable insights that can guide business decisions and optimize sales strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was provided by **AIHR - Academy to Innovate HR**, as part of a data analysis training program.

- **Dataset Link**: [Link to Dataset](  https://aihr.ac/3TQ8tXD
) 
- **Size**: 1,002 rows and 13 columns
- **Features** include: Date, Product, Quantity, Unit Price, Store Location, Cashier, Total Price, Original Price, among others.

### Data Quality:
Initially, the dataset contained missing values. These were cleaned and removed using Excel's "Go To Special" function, resulting in a clean dataset ready for analysis.

## Data Cleaning
Several data cleaning and preparation steps were performed to ensure the dataset was analysis-ready:

### Missing Values:
- Identified and removed missing entries using the "Go To Special" function in Excel.

### Data Type Corrections:
- Converted the 'Date' field from number format to a readable short date format.
- Changed 'Unit Price' formatting from general to accounting style for better financial analysis.

### Data Corrections:
- Used the "Find and Replace" function to correct spelling errors and standardize categorical entries.

### Feature Engineering:
- **Days**: Extracted the day of the week from the 'Date' using `=TEXT(Date, "ddd")`.
- **Original Unit Price**: Obtained from business owners to calculate buying prices.
- **Buying Price**: Computed as `Quantity Ã— Original Unit Price`.
- **Total Price (Sales Revenue)**: Calculated as `Quantity Ã— Sold Unit Price`.
- **Profit**: Derived as `Total Price - Buying Price`, indicating the profit per product sold.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several visualizations and a dashboard were created to explore the supermarketâ€™s sales and profit patterns:

### Dashboard Creation:
- Built a comprehensive dashboard that consolidated key metrics and answers to critical business questions in a single, easy-to-interpret view. 

The dashboard included the following:
- Total Sales
- Sales by Location
- Sales Over Time (Line Chart)
- Product Performance (Bar Chart)
- Cashier Leaderboard (Pie Chart)
- Profit Analysis by Product and Month

### Insights:
- **Product Performance**: Bread generated the highest sales at $9,214, while Apples had the lowest at $6,252.
